# Face-Mask-Detection
Detecting face masks using Python, Keras, OpenCV on real video streams
# mask_rcnn_test
Use tensorflow object_detection to finetuning a Mask R-CNN model
This Program train to detect the face mask with help of openCV,Keras/TensorFlow, and Deep Learning.
It helps to detect mask on faces in real-time potentially be used to help ensure your safety and the safety of others.
